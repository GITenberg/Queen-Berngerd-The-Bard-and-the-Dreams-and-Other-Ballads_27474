7</span>QUEEN BERNGERD</h2>
<p>Long ere the Sun the heaven arrayed,<br />
For her morning gift her Lord she prayed:<br />
&ldquo;Give me Samsoe to have and to hold,<br />
And from every maiden a crown of gold.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>The King he answered Berngerd thus:<br />
&ldquo;Madam, crave something less of us,<br />
For many a maid lives &rsquo;neath our sway<br />
To &rsquo;scape from death could the like not pay.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gentle Lord, then hear my prayer,<br />
Suffer not ladies the scarlet to wear;<br />
And, Sir, you must grant me this boon beside,<br />
Let no boor&rsquo;s son a good courser ride.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;What ladies can buy to wear they are free,<br />
And hindrance none they shall meet from me;<br />
If the son of a Boor can a horse support,<br />
&lsquo;Fore God, I&rsquo;ll never destroy his sport!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord, we&rsquo;ll that matter let drop to the
ground;<br />
With chains of steel let the land be bound,<br />
So that man or woman thereout or therein<br />
Withouten toll cannot hope to win.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should we so much steel obtain,<br />
As to bind therewith the land and main?<br />
O Madam! some mercy and kindness shew,<br />
Or expect the curse of the people now.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Ribe, to winter there, we&rsquo;ll depart,<br />
There smiths we shall find well skilled in their art;<br />
<!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Both locks and keys will we have made,<br />
And toeen and iron palisade.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faggot and coal shall the boor give free,<br />
The smith shall work without thanks or fee.<br />
My Lord, be persuaded, I rede ye do,<br />
Much benefit thence shall to thee accrue.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was King in the land before me,<br />
And a King for his father also had he;<br />
The Kings of the Danes to live contrive<br />
Without Boor and Burger skinning alive.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, what would a peasant more<br />
Than a latticed window and wicker door?<br />
What shall a peasant keep in his stall<br />
Save one draught ox and a cow withall?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;Each peasant&rsquo;s wife of a son made light<br
/>
Shall give me an ounce of gold so bright;<br />
But if to a daughter birth she give,<br />
Only the half I&rsquo;m content to receive.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>The King he turned on his other side,<br />
He&rsquo;d heard enough to suffice for that tide.<br />
As soon as sleep his brow came o&rsquo;er,<br />
Dagmar he thought stood his face before.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bitter flower, Sir King, you hold,<br />
Brings you trouble, as I foretold.<br />
Be sure if this year you seek the fray,<br />
You suffer not Berngerd at home to stay.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she with her flatteries blind your eyes,<br />
The child will weep in the cradle that lies.<br />
Take her with you, I rede and beseech,<br />
How that will boot you time will teach.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>The King has proclaimed through the whole country,<br />
To the war with him each tenth man should hie.<br />
&ldquo;My dearest Lady, worthy thou art<br />
In the field of honour to bear a part.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>The first shaft shot on the battle day<br />
To the heart of Berngerd found its way;<br />
No soul was seen with a tearful eye&mdash;<br />
Who for Berngerd would sorrow or sigh?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>Now lies Berngerd in the cold black ground,<br />
Oxen are still in the Boor&rsquo;s stall found.<br />
Berngerd she lies &rsquo;neath the dingy sward,<br />
The Danes their Monarch love and regard.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p>Now Berngerd lies in eternal pains,<br />
The boor his horse and cow retains.<br />
A name she left of such evil savour,<br />
So little the poor man did she favour.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>,<i> Berngerd</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&rsquo;Tis better to live in humble state,<br />
Than rich with a poor man&rsquo;s curse and hate;<br />
After virtue better to ceaseless strain<br />
Than the wealth of the world with scorn obtain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Woe befall her</i>, <i>Berngerd</i>.</p>

13</span>DAME MARTHA&rsquo;S FOUNTAIN</h2>
<p>Dame Martha dwelt at Karisegaard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So many kind deeds she wrought:<br />
If the winter were sharp and the rich man hard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gate the indigent sought.</p>
<p>With her hand the hungry she loved to feed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the sick she lent her aid;<br />
The prisoner oft from his chains she freed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And for souls of sinners pray&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Denmark&rsquo;s land was in peril dire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Swede around burnt and slew;<br />
The castle of Martha was wrapped in fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the church the good lady flew.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>She dwelt in the tower both night and day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There unto her none repaired;<br />
&rsquo;Neath the church roof sat the dull owl gray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And at the good lady stared.</p>
<p>In the house of the Lord she dwelt safe and content<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Till the foes their departure had
ta&rsquo;en;<br />
Then back to her ruined castle she went,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bade it be builded again.</p>
<p>There found the houseless a cover once more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the mouths of the hungry bread;<br />
But all in Karise-By <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a> wept sore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When they knew Dame Martha dead.</p>
<p>And when the Dame lay in her coffin and smil&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So calm with her pallid face,<br />
O there was never so little a child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But was brought on her to gaze.</p>
<p>The bell on the day of the burial toll&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And youth and age shed the tear;<br />
No man was ever so weak or old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But helped to lift the bier.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>When they the bier set down for a space,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And rested upon the road,<br />
A fountain sprang forth in that very place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To this hour has it flow&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>God bless for ever the pious soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her blessings no lips can tell;<br />
For oft have the sick become sound and whole,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who drank at Dame Martha&rsquo;s well!</p>
<p>The tower yet stands with gloomy nook,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Dame Martha sat of old;<br />
The stranger comes thereon to look,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to hear the story told.</p>

16</span>THE BARD AND THE DREAMS</h2>
<p>O&rsquo;er the sweet smelling meads with his lyre in his
hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bard was straying;<br />
In the twilight of evening, refreshing and bland,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His chords were playing.<br />
He sang of the flowrets that slept in the tomb,<br />
He sang of the flowrets that poured their perfume,<br />
He sang of the flowrets that yet were to bloom.</p>
<p>And the rose departed,<br />
A smile from its sepulchre darted;<br />
And the rose yet living with blushes of red<br />
Breathed sweets o&rsquo;er his head.<br />
And the rose which unborn concealed yet lies,<br />
Seemed to open before his eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By a fountain&rsquo;s side with verdure
array&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Himself he laid.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>And the murmur and hum of the pure water fleeting,<br />
And the strains, which the birds of the wood were repeating,<br
/>
And the innocent heart, which so peaceful was beating,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shed health-giving slumbers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On lids which no sorrow cumbers.</p>
<p>In the visions of sleep there came to his side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A sire with locks snow-hoary;<br />
And the songster sped with that sire for his guide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To an unknown territory.</p>
<p>On ruins majestic himself he found,<br />
The mouldering bones of old heroes lay round;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their ghosts awaking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose from their graves wild gestures making.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The youth was quaking&mdash;<br />
But the old man smiled as his mind he led<br />
To the kempion times long fled.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Then a lamp in the night&rsquo;s deep silence shone<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the dingy mould,<br />
And under the masses of fallen stone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There glittered gold.</p>
<p>To the harp then pointing the sage disappears,<br />
And the youth shed tears.<br />
&ldquo;Yes, yes, the young bard thy countenance knows,&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; So sang in wild passion the boy&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Not in vain in my bosom a holy fire glows,<br />
Not in vain thy bright lamp the grave&rsquo;s mystery shews,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bard will obey thee with joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there appeared in the dreams of the stripling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A being who held him intent;<br />
It came as in flood come the high billows rippling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like billows when ebbing it went.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>Though the look of an aged and slow female wearing,<br
/>
It ran like the breezes in spring time careering,<br />
Full often it vanished with threatening bearing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But suddenly caught he the fugitive wild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then by his breast a maiden smil&rsquo;d.<br />
&ldquo;Thee often I&rsquo;ve met on life&rsquo;s journey,&rdquo;
he said,<br />
&ldquo;And when like a meteor thou past me hast sped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen thee look backward&mdash;and
threaten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! kiss me, sweet maiden, ere on thou dost stray,<br />
I&rsquo;ve seen thee with flowers strew the wanderer&rsquo;s
way.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They lived in their brightness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When thou in this lightness,<br />
Had&rsquo;st fled farthest off; and sometimes they became<br />
A Bauta-stone over the worm-wasted frame.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;Vouchsafe me a smile,&rdquo; said the youth,
&ldquo;I entreat,<br />
I know thy course lightning-fleet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy light pinions ever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou pliest, sweet giver<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of palms, verdant palms, to the stripling so
clever,<br />
Who caught thee, though lightning fleet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again to his eye a fair vision was given,<br />
A being angelical stood in the heaven.<br />
In morn&rsquo;s fresh rose-hues drest<br />
Stood the spirit blest.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As shines from above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The starlet of love<br />
So kindled his glance toward earth&rsquo;s gentle child.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the maid to her beckons the youth she loves
dearly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When vespers are chiming and Luna shines clearly,<br
/>
So toward him beckoned the Angel, and smil&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>With rapture the songster took thither his way,<br />
Where the winged one of heaven stood beauteous and gay.<br />
But, just as he hoped that the height was surmounted,<br />
Far distant again they each other confronted.<br />
And still the Angel beckoned there,<br />
But&mdash;never, never near.<br />
&ldquo;My seraph! wilt ever avoid my embrace?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;Said the songster with mortified
mien&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;But though I&rsquo;m unable to climb to thy place,<br />
My eye thou hast blest from the mansions of grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy heaven, thou distant, I&rsquo;ve
seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His slumber departed, his visions they fled,<br />
But oft when he harped they came into his head.<br />
&ldquo;Blest, trebly blest, may our life be regarded,<br />
Far unto me hear threefold life is awarded.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;See the roselet departed,<br />
A smile from its tomb has darted.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rose, which yet lives in blushes and
bloom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathes o&rsquo;er me perfume.<br />
Yes, from its concealment, the unborn rose<br />
Before me seems to unclose.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>KING OLUF THE SAINT</h2>
<p>King Oluf and his brother bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Bout Norroway&rsquo;s rocks a parley hold.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>So sweet in Drontheim
&rsquo;tis to dwell</i>!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one of us two who best can sail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall rule o&rsquo;er Norroway&rsquo;s hill and
dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who first of us reaches our native ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er all the region shall King be
crown&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Harald Haardrode answer made:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Aye, let it be even as thou hast said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I to-day must sail with thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou shalt change vessels, I swear, with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For thou hast got the Dragon of speed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall make with the Ox a poor figure indeed.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;The dragon is swift as the clouds in chase,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ox he moveth at lazy pace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, Harald, what I shall say to thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What thou hast proposed well pleaseth me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my ship in aught be better than thine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m readily, cheerfully lend thee mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do thou the Dragon so sprightly take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I with the Ox will the journey make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first to the Church we&rsquo;ll bend our way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere our hand on sail or on oar we lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And into the Church Saint Oluf trode,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His beautiful hair like the bright gold
glow&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>But soon out of breath there came a man:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy brother is sailing off, fast as he
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them sail, my friend, who to sail may choose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The word of our Lord we will not lose,</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;The Mass is the word of our blessed Lord.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take water, ye swains, for our table board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will sit at board, and the bread we will taste,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then unto the sea-shore will we haste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now down they all sped to the ocean strand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the Ox lay rocking before the land.</p>
<p>And speedily they to the ocean bore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The anchor, and cable, the sail and oar.</p>
<p>Saint Oluf he stood on the prow when on board:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now forward, thou Ox, in the name of the
Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grappled the Ox by the horn so white:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hie now as if thou went clover to
bite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then forward the Ox began to hie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In his wake roll&rsquo;d the billows
boisterously.</p>
<p>He hallooed to the lad on the yard so high:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do we the Dragon of Harald draw
nigh?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>&ldquo;No more of the pomps of the world I see,<br />
Than the uppermost top of the good oak tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, &rsquo;neath the land of Norroway, skim<br />
Bright silken sails with a golden rim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, &rsquo;neath Norroway&rsquo;s mountains
proud,<br />
The Dragon bearing of sail a cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, I see, by Norroway&rsquo;s side,<br />
The Dragon gallantly forward stride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the ribs of the Ox a blow he gave:<br />
&ldquo;Now faster, faster, over the wave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He struck the Ox on the eye with force:<br />
&ldquo;To the haven much speedier thou must course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then forward the Ox began to leap,<br />
No sailor on deck his stand could keep.</p>
<p>Then cords he took, and his mariners fast<br />
He tied to the vessel&rsquo;s sheets and mast.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas then, &rsquo;twas then, the steersman cried:<br />
&ldquo;But who shall now the vessel guide?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>His white gloves off Saint Oluf throws,<br />
And he himself to the rudder goes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O we will sail o&rsquo;er cliff and height,<br />
The nearest way like a line of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So o&rsquo;er the hills and dales they career,<br />
To them they became like water clear.</p>
<p>They sailed along o&rsquo;er the mountains blue,<br />
Then out came running the Elfin crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sails o&rsquo;er the gold in which we joy?<br />
Our ancient father who dares annoy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elf, turn to stone and a stone remain,<br />
Till I by this path return again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they sailed o&rsquo;er Skaaney&rsquo;s mountains tall,<br
/>
And stones became the little elves all.</p>
<p>Out came a Carline, with spindle and rok:<br />
&ldquo;Saint Oluf! why sailest thou us to mock?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saint Oluf, thou who the red beard hast,<br />
Through my chamber wall thy ship hath passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>With a glance of scorn did Saint Oluf say:<br />
&ldquo;Stand there a flint rock for ever and aye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unchided, unhindered, they bravely sailed on,<br />
Before them yielded both stock and stone.</p>
<p>Still onward they sailed in such gallant guise,<br />
That no man upon them could fix his eyes.</p>
<p>Saint Oluf a bow before his knee bent,<br />
Behind the sail dropped the shaft he sent.</p>
<p>From the prow Saint Oluf a barb shot free,<br />
Behind the Ox fell the shaft in the sea.</p>
<p>Saint Oluf he trusted In Christ alone,<br />
And therefore home by three days he won.</p>
<p>That made Harald with fury storm,<br />
Of a laidly dragon he took the form.</p>
<p>But the Saint was a man of devotion full,<br />
And the Saint gat Norroway&rsquo;s land to rule.</p>
<p>Into the Church Saint Oluf strode,<br />
He thanked the Saviour in fervent mode.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>Saint Oluf walked the Church about,<br />
There shone a glory his ringlets out.</p>
<p>Whom God doth help makes bravely his way,<br />
His enemies win but shame and dismay.</p>

<p>Would it not be more dignified<br />
To run up debts on every side,<br />
And then to pay your debts refuse,<br />
Than write for rascally Reviews?<br />
And lectures give to great and small,<br />
In pothouse, theatre, and town-hall,<br />
Wearing your brains by night and day<br />
To win the means to pay your way?<br />
I vow by him who reigns in [hell],<br />
It would be more respectable!</p>

What right have you to answer in this strain?<br />
Whilst I&rsquo;m a man, a prince of the creation,<br />
You&rsquo;re but a female woman by your station;<br />
A creature for man&rsquo;s sovereign service born,<br />
Whose fitting wages are contempt and scorn.<br />
A creature formed to dive down in the sea<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
